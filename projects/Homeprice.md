For this project, I drew inspiration from the BMI index. The Body Mass Index is designed to help determine the weight in relation to a person's height. The code will calculate and return a value, and based on this value, the function will provide a description indicating what the number signifies. For instance, any number below 18.5 indicates that the person's weight and height resulted in them being underweight, while a number over 30 suggests that the person is overweight. This BMI index is valuable for individuals who are unaware of the correlation between their height and weight, helping them assess whether they should be concerned.

This project contributes to my better understanding of Java libraries and reveals gaps in my knowledge from my introductory class during my freshman year. Exploring different libraries and recognizing complex tools I may have missed enhances my skills for future projects and my future career.

When discussing this project with different people, I inquired about the best way to convey a friendly return message. Given that people may struggle with health-related issues, particularly regarding their weight, they don't need code to tell them they're unhealthy. This project has helped me improve my empathy and sympathy towards others. Dealing with the emotional aspect of the code will stick with me because I aim not to treat technology as merely providing yes or no answers but also to be sympathetic to users who will be utilizing the products I produce.
