*What are Design Patterns*

When I first heard about design patterns, I was very confused since I hadn't ever experienced 
using them before, until my software engineering class. In that class, we learned about 
reusable solutions to problems commonly encountered in software design and development. 
With a clear understanding, they can provide a structured approach to solving recurring design 
challenges, which in turn promotes good practices and maintainability in codebases. I also
took a deep dive into the different categories of design patterns. From my research, 
I've identified three categories I want to implement in my code. They are:

1. Creation patterns (which focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in 
creating objects while hiding implementation details).
2. Structural patterns (which deal with the composition of classes or objects and form 
larger structures, emphasizing relationships between classes and their interactions).
3. Behavioral patterns (which focus on key points like communication between objects, 
defining how they interact, and distributing responsibilities among them).

*Bring it All Together*
In software engineering, it's important to know how to design software that's strong, 
can grow, and is easy to keep up. Using structural design patterns helps with this. 
These patterns are like tried-and-true tricks that make it easier to build software 
that works well and can change without breaking.

First off, these patterns help organize code and make it easier to understand. 
They break big problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, the 
Composite Pattern lets you treat groups of things and individual things the same way, 
which makes code more readable and lets you reuse parts of it in different places.

Also, they help manage differences between parts of the software and how they work 
together. The Bridge Pattern, for instance, keeps different parts separate so you 
can change one without messing up the others. And the Adapter Pattern makes it easier 
to connect different systems by giving them a common way to talk, so you don't have 
to deal with all the details every time.

Plus, these patterns make software more resilient and easier to keep up. The Facade 
Pattern hides complicated stuff behind a simple front, so you don't have to deal with 
it unless you need to. And the Decorator Pattern lets you add new features without 
messing up what's already there. This is super useful when things are always changing.

So, learning about these design patterns isn't just for school â€“ it's crucial for 
building software that works well in the real world. They help make code easier to 
understand, manage, and adapt, which are all key skills for software engineers. 
Mastering them sets you up for success and shows you're serious about making great software.
