## A Smart Question.

  In seeking an example of a ‘smart question,’ I found a user who, in short, needs a fast method to handle arrays with lengths up to a couple of hundred thousand in a few seconds, with sub-quadratic time complexity. If possible, include a sample JS implementation as the user’s understanding of some data structures is not solid. In the question, the user has expressed the dire need for help, and this was their last resort. 
	
   The user first explained the goal of this program they want to accomplish and the different resources they used to find the solution. They then showed why these resources were not successful and provided reasons, along with a link for clarification. The article emphasizes using different resources before turning to forums for help. Another thing the user’s question added was the goal of the problem. The user did not just ask ‘why isn’t this working’ or ‘please help.’ They took their time to understand what the code was trying to do but failed in one aspect of it, which was the BigO notation. 
	
   Looking at the given questions the user had asked, I better understand what template I should be using when asking important questions that I might stumble upon in future career I aspire to. The author also expresses examples codes they had to convey about the main issue. The articles demonstrates the importance of describing symptoms of the problem, the environment, and the diagnostic steps taken to try and pinpoint the problem yourself beforehand. This is especially important when asking for help since others need to know the direction your code is heading and help you lead to the path to the solution. They also provided examples of what the code is trying to accomplish. 
	
   Seeing this example of how to ask a smart question will help me better at asking them. An aspect of what i might include in the question would be showing examples of the code I want to absolve and also showing that the resources I found were not helpful, with a brief explanation of  why it didn’t help. The user also uses a tone of professionalism by taking the time to express gratitude for helping them out. 


## Not so Smart Question.

  In my search for a ‘not so smart question to ask,’ I stumbled upon this question: ‘get data from multiple entries in the same cell.’ A brief summary of the context involves calculating two different tables and determining the total cost per activity. The user has exhibited attributes mentioned in the article ‘How to Ask Questions the Smart Way,’ specifically what not to do. The article emphasizes the importance of asking grammatically correct questions and avoiding sloppiness. Requesting answer to your question should meet high standards when seeking response. 
	
   We must keep in mind that these websites are merely c9luntar, and individuals responding in these forums have no obligation to answer sloppy questions. The article notes that many of these people work in professional settings, and those asking questions should help for a deeper understanding of what they are seeking. The article implies that individuals who write sloppy questions may be perceived negatively. 
	
  Analyzing the user’s question, I now understand how it was asked sloppily. What caught my eye were the grammatical errors the user made. If I were the user, I would have received the questions to ensure it is professionally accepted. Grammatical problems may convey that the question is less important and can be pushed aside. Double-checking to ensure what I am asking for is well-suited and tailored for a professional answer is crucial. The user also failed to realize that Goolge is another tool that could be used to solve the problem at hand. Understanding that there are different resources available to us should be  the first step in seeking an answer. It’s essential to consider if the question you’re asking has been frequently asked before. Th search engine of Stack Overflow has the ability to check similar contexts to your question and might direct your to the solution.

## Conclusion

  In comparing a 'smart question' with a 'not so smart question,' it's evident that effective communication plays a crucial role in seeking help. The user in the first example demonstrated a clear and proactive approach, detailing their program's goal, utilizing various resources, and acknowledging the complexity of the issue. This serves as a valuable template for future inquiries, emphasizing the importance of providing examples and expressing gratitude for a more constructive interaction.

  On the other hand, the encounter with a 'not so smart question' highlights the pitfalls of unclear communication and lack of professionalism. The grammatical errors and imprecise nature of the question underscore the importance of self-checking, grammatical correctness, and utilizing available resources like Google before turning to online forums. The comparison stresses that asking questions professionally increases the likelihood of receiving helpful responses, considering the voluntary nature of assistance in online forums.
