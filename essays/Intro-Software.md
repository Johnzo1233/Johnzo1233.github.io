## Why Intereseted In Software Engineer? 

I've recently developed a better grasp of what software engineering comprises during my undergraduate studies. Even though data science has always been my passion, until now I had never really explored the field of software engineering. Learning about the broad scope of Software Engineering has sparked a renewed curiosity about the nuances of the field. My appreciation for the creative elements of ordinary design has grown significantly as a result of learning about these engineers' methodical approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. I now see how crucial it is to consider user needs in order to create software that is of higher quality, improves the user experience, and promotes regular usage.

## Skills that come from Learning.

I am especially drawn to the software engineering user-friendly models in my field of interest. What inspires me is realizing that our sector helps people who are looking for help with issues that go beyond what they can learn about computer science. Setting the needs of the user first is an essential competency, given that we want our products to be used extensively. Being proficient in a variety of programming languages is another skill I intend to carry with me on my journey. Accepting the challenge of learning multiple languages improves flexibility in a variety of work environments. Even though it might not be the most fun task, knowing various languages has made reading code much easier for me.

One of the most important things that will help me manage big data analysis is my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Since a wide range of consumers will use our product, I hope to use this information to incorporate user feedback for ongoing product improvement. My ability to work with algorithms will improve our product's functionality planning and increase the overall effectiveness of our data analysis procedures.
