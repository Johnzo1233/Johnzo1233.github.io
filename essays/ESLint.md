*Getting to Know the Software*

Learning a new skill set requires guidance and assistance all the time. With my 
experience using ESLint in IntelliJ, I found that the support provided was all I needed. The new 
environment that ESLint introduced me to required a different set of skills that will be beneficial 
for my future career. Initially, my impression of ESLint was quite negative; installing new 
software and setting up Volta Node on my computer seemed like a disaster. However, at first, I 
felt lost without the familiar programming eyes, but once I got the hang of it, it became easier. 
One positive aspect of ESLint is its ability to integrate with websites like GitHub, which is 
excellent for sharing projects with the wider world. You must master it before fully appreciating 
the wonders it offers.

*Double Edge Sword*

When coding with ESLint in IntelliJ, you may encounter green checkmarks or warning signs, 
but trust themâ€”they are a wonderful addition. They ease the pain of wondering why 
certain parts of your code aren't working. If you haven't used IntelliJ, you might encounter 
situations where your code doesn't work, and you have to trace back to find the error. With 
IntelliJ's assistance, you can see warning signs or red lines underneath your code to indicate 
potential issues. For example, when one of my professors taught us to create a function using a 
loop, he mistakenly used a for loop without a break, causing the code to run indefinitely and 
consume memory. IntelliJ quickly identified the mistake and provided a brief explanation of why 
the code was problematic. This feature is particularly helpful when dealing with limited memory 
space and can save you countless headaches down the road.

One of the most frustrating aspects of using this software is the warning function. It 
seems almost like a double-edged sword. While coding, IntelliJ will inform you that you are 
using a variable or a const in your code, which can be annoying because IntelliJ doesn't allow 
you to finish coding before flagging an unused function. However, this isn't a significant issue 
since you can choose to ignore it automatically.


*Thoughts?*

In conclusion, learning and adapting to new tools like ESLint within the IntelliJ 
environment can be challenging initially, especially when navigating through the intricacies of 
installation and setup. Despite the initial hurdles, such as the daunting task of integrating Volta 
Node and the frustration of dealing with unused functions warnings, the benefits of these tools 
become evident over time. The integration with GitHub allows for seamless project sharing, and
the error detection features of IntelliJ, such as the red lines indicating code issues, serve as 
valuable aids in debugging and optimizing code. These features, coupled with the ability to 
manage memory usage effectively, significantly enhance the coding process, making it more 
efficient and less prone to errors. Overall, while there may be a steep learning curve, the 
investment in mastering these tools is worthwhile for any developer looking to improve their 
workflow and ensure high-quality, optimized code.
